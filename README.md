## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `deno install`, start a development server:

```sh
deno run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
deno run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
deno run build
```

You can preview the production build with `deno run preview`.
